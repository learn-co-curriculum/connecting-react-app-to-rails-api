# Connecting React App to Rails API

## Objectives

* Connecting a Create React App to IronStarter Rails API
* Review Rack CORS and add Create React App Domain to Allowed Origins
* Create List View Component of campaigns from IronStarter API

## Introduction: Connecting Apps With React And Redux

- At the Beta maybe just something as simple as grabbing the JSON in an index.html. Super simple to show them it all works without all the complexity of react
- Review Rack Cors and how to add Create React App server domain host to the config/initializers/cors.rb allowed origins
- Connect a Fetch API request to the final Rails WEB API app (IronStarter)
- Grab the code from the Campaigns CRUD Actions and put it in here. Build out a single component that just spits out the JSON from some API hit
